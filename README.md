[graphite]: https://github.com/rdavison/graphite-layout "Graphite is a highly optimized, well balanced, general purpose keyboard layout designed to accommodate the real world needs of typists looking for a great “out-of-the-box” experience. Its design incorporates many contemporary theories about layouts to find a balance between comfort and speed.
